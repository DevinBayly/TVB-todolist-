so far I have a few things that need doing
	tvb
		finish installing the matlab program
		install the matlab8 interface program using apt-get
		finish with the other interface program installations 
			maybe make a file with the names of the files that need
			to get installed with the apt-get command
			maybe first make a file that has all the names
		run another nipype.test() and see if there are still two error
		use the website link that lia sent me and see if there is 
anything interesting about the program that I didn't know about()
			this would be something to do when I have time in the 
			evening to use somewhat still productively
	basic computer
		figure out what is going on with the vim program
			get it reinstalled with apt-get for python2
		finish learning the labs on the git page 
	around the house
