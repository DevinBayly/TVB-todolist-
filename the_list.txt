so far I have a few things that need doing
	tvb
		XX finish installing the matlab program
		
		XX install the matlabspm8 interface program using apt-get
			O there seems to be a problem with the matlab path. Following satra's instructions on the Neurostars webpage, I can't run which spm, and get a path back to the folder
			XX searched full computer for spm.m and found it in the usr/share
		X finish with the other interface program installations 

			maybe make a file with the names of the files that need
			to get installed with the apt-get command
			maybe first make a file that has all the names
		
			OX had to find another way to install Freesurfer
				maybe even the MNE and MRtrix too
				x MRtrix is available through the Neurodeb repo
					xx set path, changed config file threads to 2 (nproc), and ran mrview successfully
				x MNE available as python-mne
					struggling to import it into miniconda setting (pythonpath breaks things)
					perhaps create a binstar set of packages that are necessary for SCRIPTS
					xx success by placing sys.path appending py script in the .ipython/default_profile/startup directory
				x starting the free surfer download
				XX Finished the Freesurfer download and installation 
			Install Camino and connectomeviewer 
				XX successful

			Get AFNI updated, and running
				O Neurodeb copy is very old.

		x run another nipype.test() and see if there are still two error
			O yes there are still two fails based off FSL
				XX the nipype.test() now passes all 7454 tests 
				unfortunately there are 10 skips (interface dependencies?)
			xx managed to get FSL installed on the computer
			O and there is one error based on the matlab not being setup properly
				xx seems to be passing whatever test failed before	
		
		
		x matlab takes forever to load, figure out what's going on
			still loading close to thirty mins later
			maybe it has to do with the fact it is loading the entire library of modules I downloaded with it. 
				find way to specify just matlab load
			XX This was resolved by tracking down the permissions of the .matlab directory and recreating the license file upon load. 

		read the two articles
			XX simulator of primate brain dynamics
				the pieces on validating the TVB model using the V1 and V2 visual streams are incredible
			integrating neuroinformatics tools
			XX read Jirsa and Deco on resting state networks

		read Tim's scripts article	
				
		read about the software related to the scripts (FSL and Freesurfer)

		x start setting up a VM to reproduce the install procedure documented on github
			x I got as far as downloading Oracle for Ubuntu this evening 
			xx finished installing debian 8, fired up and recieved a slow response
				O the vm debian took 24 seconds to echo 10000 numbers compared to 1s for the native ubuntu 
		
		Work as far into the Nipype beginners guide as i can	
			x starting the very first tutorial 
			X successfull created a workflow made up of three nodes
			O having trouble running the workflow. Need to be able to check the workflow log

		X track down someone at the U of A who can be my advisor in this project
			O At this point I have sent out two emails 
			O Followed by 4 others to individuals in different departments
			X Kobus Barnard will cover for my HPC cycles although he is on sabbatical
			X Stephen Allen wonders about whether I would work in his lab
			x Wilson says lets talk in august when he's back


		X Follow up with the HPC (high power computing) facility on campus
			O Sent one email, waiting for response
			O U of a researchers to sponsor me for resources

		use the website link that lia sent me to explore the webpage TVB
			xx Now I'm validated and registered for use

		register with the human connectome project
			xx validated and able to download data


		get SCRIPTS setup on my computer
			XX cloned both Scripts gits onto my computer for easier access
			O make both capable of running commits from
				CRLF error fatal: CRLF would be replaced by LF in scripts/compute_region_centres.prj. 
			O perhaps fork the scripts repo instead of trying to create it and commit from my host machine
		

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	basic computer
		xx figure out what is going on with the vim program
			xx get it reinstalled with apt-get for python2
		finish learning the labs on the git page 
			Xx managed to set up a git page with this document as contents
			Xx wrote a brief script to automate the process of adding commiting and pushing
