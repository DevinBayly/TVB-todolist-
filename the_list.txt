so far I have a few things that need doing
	tvb
		XX finish installing the matlab program
		
		XX install the matlab8 interface program using apt-get

		X finish with the other interface program installations 
			maybe make a file with the names of the files that need
			to get installed with the apt-get command
			maybe first make a file that has all the names

			OX had to find another way to install Freesurfer
				maybe even the ANTs and MRtrix too		
				x starting the free surfer download
				XX Finished the Freesurfer download and installation 

		x run another nipype.test() and see if there are still two error
			O yes there are still two fails based off FSL
				XX the nipype.test() now passes all 7454 tests 
				unfortunately there are 10 skips (interface dependencies?)
			xx managed to get FSL installed on the computer
			O and there is one error based on the matlab not being setup properly
				xx seems to be passing whatever test failed before	
		
		
		x matlab takes forever to load, figure out what's going on
			still loading close to thirty mins later
			maybe it has to do with the fact it is loading the entire library of modules I downloaded with it. 
				find way to specify just matlab load
			XX This was resolved by tracking down the permissions of the .matlab directory and recreating the license file upon load. 

		read the two articles
			simulator of primate brain dynamics
			integrating neuroinformatics tools
		
		read description of the TVB input dataset (output of SCRIPTS pipeline)

		read about the software related to the scripts (FSL and Freesurfer)

		x start setting up a VM to reproduce the install procedure documented on github
			x I got as far as downloading Oracle for Ubuntu this evening 
			xx finished installing debian 8, fired up and recieved a slow response
				O the vm debian took 24 seconds to echo 10000 numbers compared to 1s for the native ubuntu 
		
		Work as far into the Nipype beginners guide as i can	

		X track down someone at the U of A who can be my advisor in this project
			O At this point I have sent out two emails 
			O Followed by 4 others to individuals in different departments


		X Follow up with the HPC (high power computing) facility on campus
			O Sent one email, waiting for response
			O U of a researchers to sponsor me for resources

		use the website link that lia sent me to explore the webpage TVB


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	basic computer
		xx figure out what is going on with the vim program
			xx get it reinstalled with apt-get for python2
		finish learning the labs on the git page 
			Xx managed to set up a git page with this document as contents
			Xx wrote a brief script to automate the process of adding commiting and pushing
