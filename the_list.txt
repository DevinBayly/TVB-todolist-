so far I have a few things that need doing
	tvb
		XX finish installing the matlab program
		XX install the matlab8 interface program using apt-get
		X finish with the other interface program installations 
			maybe make a file with the names of the files that need
			to get installed with the apt-get command
			maybe first make a file that has all the names

			O had to find another way to install Freesurfer
				maybe even the ANTs and MRtrix too		

		x run another nipype.test() and see if there are still two error
			O yes there are still two fails based off FSL
			O and there is one error based on the matlab not being setup properly
	
		matlab takes forever to load, figure out what's going on
		
		read the two articles
			simulator of primate brain dynamics
			integrating neuroinformatics tools
		
		read description of the TVB input dataset (output of SCRIPTS pipeline)

		read about the software related to the scripts (FSL and Freesurfer)

		start setting up a VM to reproduce the install procedure documented on github
		
		Work as far into the Nipype beginners guide as i can	

		use the website link that lia sent me and see if there is 
			anything interesting about the program that I didn't know about()
			this would be something to do when I have time in the 
			evening to use somewhat still productively
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	basic computer
